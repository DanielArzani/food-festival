# Food Festival

## Description

This was an existing web application designed for a food festival and turned into a progressive web application—making it more performant and efficient and optimizing it for use on mobile devices.

As apps grow in size and complexity, their load times can start to lag. And when users around the world try to access those apps from aging mobile devices with spotty connections, load times can slow to a snail’s pace. That’s why performance optimization is so crucial to a good experience for every user.

To address these performance issues, Progressive Web Applications, or PWAs, blend the benefits of a traditional browser experience with those of a mobile application. PWAs can ensure applications work without an internet connection by using the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses.

To deliver smaller application bundle sizes to the client, several optimizations were used through webpack; compressing assets—from minifying JavaScript and CSS files to compressing images as well as lazy loading to defer loading certain assets until they're needed by the application.
